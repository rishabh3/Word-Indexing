40->ï»¿Pattern matching is to find a pattern, which is relatively small, in a text, which is supposed to be very large
421->.
In the text editor, a pattern is often a word, whose length is around 10, and the length of the text is a few hundred up to one million
693->.
In the case of two-dimensional, the typical application is a pattern matching in computer visiontext is a few hundred up to one million
732->.
A pattern is about (100, 100) and text typically (1024,1024) pattern matching in computer visiontext is a few hundred up to one million
919->.
Either one-dimensional or two-dimensional, the text is very large, and therefore a fast algorithm to find the occurrence(s) of pattern in it is needed
1010->.
At first the pattern is set to the left end of the text, and matching process startsast algorithm to find the occurrence(s) of pattern in it is needed

After a mismatch is found, pattern is shifted one place right and a new matching process starts, and so onthe occurrence(s) of pattern in it is needed
