Did Jim Morrison Really Die
The Case
  During the summer of 1971 Jim Morrison and his girlfriend PamelaCourson went to Paris for a vacation
  On July 5th Morrison was discovered inthe bathtub by his girlfriend dead of a heart attack at age 27
Suspicious facts
        Only Courson saw his body no one else
  After the death was declaredMorrison's road manager was the only person notified
  He flew to Paris andwas met by Courson at Jim's flat
  All he ever saw was a sealed coffin anda death certificate no body
        No one knew who had signed the death certificate
  Later in Morrison's1980 biography it was revealed that there had been no autopsy no police reportand no doctor presentA
  Also no autopsy was performed after death
        When Morrison's girlfriend filed the death certificate at the Americanembasy she said that there were no living relatives which meant that thefuneral could take place with no one being notified
  In reality Morrison'sfamily lived in Arlington Virginia
        Morrison's death was not revealed untill a week after he had diedand the press wasn't notified untill two days after the funeralQ
  Morrison'sroad manager said that he ahd died of natural causes
        Courson or someone else had started a rumor that Morrison had boughtheroin earlier that evening at a Paris hangoutn¥‹U
  Herroin and alchohol is whatsupposedly killed him
  Yet for all the drugs Morrison did he never mentionedheroin and he was afraid of needles
        The absence of an autopsy and police report is very suspicious andthe lie about his parents and the quick 
burial
 forestalled any furtherinquires
  A doctor could have been bribed to fake a death certificate
Possible Conclusions
        
Morrison is really dead
  His friends just played down his death toprotect his privacy
  This was done in an attempt to keep his funeral fromturning into a circus like those of Janis Joplin or Jimmy Hendrix
        
Morrison is hiding out
  At the time of his death Morrison's life wasfucked up
  Some of the charges against him were two counts of profanity andindecent exposure in Miami with jail time if his appeal failed
  A ten yearjail term for being drunk and disorderly on an airliner and over TWENTYpaternity suits filed against him‹U
        Morrison was also sick of being a rock star and had been telling peoplethat for yearsU
  He also said that he just wanted to start over fresh so hecould just write
  His girlfriend had been encouraging him to develop himselfas a poet for years
