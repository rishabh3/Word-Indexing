Scilab is a programming language associated with a rich collection of numerical
algorithms covering many aspects of scientific computing problems. From the software
point of view, Scilab is an interpreted language. This generally allows to get faster
development processes, because the user directly accesses a high-level language, with
a rich set of features provided by the library. The Scilab language is meant to be
extended so that user-defined data types can be defined with possibly overloaded
operations. Scilab users can develop their own modules so that they can solve their
particular problems. The Scilab language allows to dynamically compile and link other
languages such as Fortran and C: this way, external libraries can be used as if they were
a part of Scilab built-in features. Scilab also interfaces LabVIEW, a platform and
development environment for a visual programming language from National
Instruments. From the license point of view, Scilab is a free software in the sense that
the user does not pay for it and Scilab is an open source software, provided under the
Cecill license. The software is distributed with source code, so that the user has an access
to Scilabâ€™s most internal aspects. Most of the time, the user downloads and installs a
binary version of Scilab, since the Scilab consortium provides Windows, Linux and Mac
OS executable versions. Online help is provided in many local languages. From the
scientific point of view, Scilab comes with many features. At the very beginning of
Scilab, features were focused on linear algebra. But, rapidly, the number of features
extended to cover many areas of scientific computing.
The following is a short list of its capabilities:
â€¢ Linear algebra, sparse matrices
â€¢ Polynomials and rational functions
â€¢ Interpolation, approximation
â€¢ Linear, quadratic and non-linear optimization
â€¢ Ordinary Differential Equation solver and Differential Algebraic Equations solver
â€¢ Classic and robust control, Linear Matrix Inequality optimization
â€¢ Differentiable and non-differentiable optimization
â€¢ Signal processing
â€¢ Statistics
6Scilab provides many graphics features including a set of plotting functions which allow
us to create 2D and 3D plots as well as user interfaces. The Xcos environment provides
a hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator.
How to get and install Scilab
Whatever the platform is (i.e. Windows, Linux or Mac), Scilab binaries can be
downloaded directly from the Scilab homepage http://www.scilab.org or from the
Download area http://www.scilab.org/download. Scilab binaries are provided for both
32 and 64-bit platforms so that they match the target installation machine. Scilab can
also be downloaded in source form, so that we can compile Scilab by ourselves and
produce our own binary. Compiling Scilab and generating a binary is especially
interesting when we want to understand or debug an existing feature, or when we want
to add a new feature. To compile Scilab, some prerequisites binary files are necessary,
which are also provided in the Download center. Moreover, a Fortran and a C compiler
are required.
Become familiar with Scilab
The useful workspace in Scilab consists of several window:

 


The console for making calculations
The editor for writing programs
The graphics windows for displaying graphics
The embedded help
The general environment and the console
After double clicking the icon to launch Scilab, the Scilab environment by default
consists of the following docked windows: The console, files and variables browsers
and the command history. In the console, after the prompt
-->
Just type a command and press the Enter key (Windows and Linux) or the Return key
(Mac OS X) in the keyboard to obtain the corresponding result.
7The menu bar
The menus listed below are particularly useful.
Applications
â€¢
â€¢
The command history allows us to find all the commands from previous
sessions to the current session.
The variables browser allows us to find all variables previously used during
the current session.
Edit
Preferences (in Scilab menu under Mac OS X) allows us to set and customize colours,
fonts and font size in the console and in the editor, which is very useful for screen
projection. Clicking on Clear Console clears the entire content of the console. In this
case, the command history is still available and calculations made during the session
remain in memory. Commands that have been erased are still available through the
keyboardâ€™s arrow keys.
The Editor
Typing directly into the console has two disadvantages: it is not possible to save the
commands and it is not easy to edit multiple lines of instruction. The editor is the
appropriate tool to run multiple instructions.
Opening the Editor
To open the editor from the console, click on the first icon in the toolbar or on
Applications ïƒ  SciNotes in the menu bar. The editor opens with a default file named
â€œUntitled 1 â€œ.
Saving
Any file can be saved by clicking on File ïƒ  Save as
The extension â€œ.sce â€œat the end of a file name will launch automatically Scilab when
opening it (except under Linux and Mac OS X).
Copying into the console, executing a program
In clicking on Execute in the menu bar, three options are available:
8â€¢ Execute â€œ...file with no echo â€œ(Ctrl+Shift+E under Windows and Linux, Cmd+Shift+
E under Mac OS X): the file is executed without writing the program in the console
(saving the file first is mandatory).
â€¢ Execute â€œ... file with echo â€œ(Ctrl+L under Windows and Linux, Cmd+L under Mac
OS X): rewrites the file into the console and executes it.
â€¢ Execute â€œ...until the caret, with echo â€œ(Ctrl+E under Windows and Linux, Cmd+E
under Mac OS X): rewrites the selection chosen with the mouse into the console and
executes it or executes the file data until the caret position defined by the user.
Standard copy/paste can also be used.
The graphics window
Opening a graphics window
A graphics window opens automatically when making any plot. It is possible to plot
curves, surfaces and sequences of points.
Online help
To access the online help, click on ? ïƒ Scilab Help in the menu bar, or type in the
console:
ïƒ  help
To get help with any function, type help in the console followed by the name of the
appropriate function. For example:
ïƒ  help sin
displays help for sine function.
