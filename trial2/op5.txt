isotretinoin (accutane) treatment of acne


Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment of acne  
-----------------------------------------

   It  has long been known that vitamin A has a regulatory effect
on  growth and differentiation of epithelial  tissue.  Since  the
1940's,  high  doses  of  vitamin  A have been  employed  in  the
treatment of severe acne and various disorders of keratinization.
Vitamin A's use, however, was limited by its side effects - liver
toxicity and pseudotumor cerebri in particular.  In an attempt to
find  a  drug  with a better therapeutic index  than  vitamin  A,
several synthetic retinoids have been developed (1).

   One of these,  isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid),  was first
synthesized in 1955.  It was largely ignored until the results of
the  first major clinical trial demonstrating its efficacy in the
treatment  of severe recalcitrant cystic acne were  published  in
1972 (2). in 1982, isotretinoin was approved in the United States
for  that single indication only.  Its trade name is Accutane.  A
major  feature  of  this drug is that  it  produces  a  prolonged
remission  in patients with severe cystic acne,  many of whom had
not  responded to other therapies.  The most striking  discovery,
however,  is that the remission is often sustained for months  or
years  after  the four- to five-month treatment course  has  been
completed.

Transport and metabolism of vitamin A (retinol) and isotretinoin

   Significant  differences  between vitamin A  and  isotretinoin
with  regard to their transport and metabolism account for  their
difference  in  toxicity  (3).  The  major source  of  vitamin  A
(retinol)  is the conversion of dietary plant carotenoids in  the
intestinal mucosa. Retinol is stored in the liver, which contains
over  90%  of  body  stores.   Mobilization  from  the  liver  is
accomplished  when  retinol  is bound  to  a  specific  transport
protein,  retinol  binding protein,  that delivers it to tissues.
Plasma  levels of vitamin A tend to remain constant despite  wide
variations in diet. Extremely high dietary intake (eg. polar bear
liver,   vitamin   A   tablets)  produces   hypervitaminosis   A.
Hypervitaminosis  A results in greatly increased  hepatic  stores
and subsequent toxicity.

   In contrast, isotretinoin binds to serum albumin. Isotretinoin
is  readily  absorbed  orally and put into  circulation  via  the
portal  system.  It  is  not significantly stored  in  any  organ
system, and plasma levels vary with the amount ingested.

Mode of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne

   Acne is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit.  The pathogenesis
of  acne is believed to include several factors.  Among them  are
excessive sebum production, abnormal keratinization of follicular
epithelium,    proliferation    of   'Propionibacterium   acnes',
inflammation, and hormonal regulation of sebaceous glands.

   Isotreinoin affects several of these mechanisms, but its exact
mode of action is not known.  Isotretinoin causes pronounced  but
temporary inhibition of sebum production and atrophy of sebaceous
glands  (4).  In  general,  after two weeks of  standard  therapy
(1mg/kg/day),  sebum production is decreased by more than 50% and
by  the  end of a four- to five- month treatment  period,  it  is
reduced  by greater than 90%.  While there are some patients  who
continue to have decreased sebum production months to years after
cessation  of therapy,  the sebum production of the vast majority
returns  to the baseline level within a few months.  Since  sebum
production returns to normal in most patients,  this is obviously
not  the sole mechanism for the prolonged remission of acne  seen
in these individuals.  Many of these patients continue to improve
even after therapy is discontinued (5).

   Some   investigators   believe  that   isotretinoin   inhibits
follicular keratinization in patients with acne.  They  postulate
that  this  prevents the formation of comedomes  (whiteheads  and
blackheads), the precursors of inflammatory acne lesions.

   Isotretinoin  does decrease the quantity of  'Propionbacterium
acnes' in treated patients.  This organism is normal flora within
the  follicles.  Increased numbers of these bacteria in  patients
with  acne  produce various chemotactic factors and enzymes  that
may increase inflammation. The decreased number of these bacteria
in  isotretinoin-treated  patients is thought to be a  result  of
decreased sebum production,  producing a poor environment for the
proliferation  of  this  organism.   Therefore,   the   decreased
bacterial counts are thought to be secondary, and not the primary
mechanism of action of Accutane.

Clinical side effects

   Mucocutaneous  side  effects  are  the  most  common  seen  in
isotretinoin  treatment  (6).  More  than 90% of  people  treated
experience  cheilitis,  usually  within the first  two  weeks  of
treatment.  This is most easily treated with bland emolliation. A
generalized xerosis is very common,  but frequently acne patients
view  this  as a beneficial rather than  adverse  effect.  Should
xerosis become problematic, the use of a noncomedogenic emollient
lotion  can be employed.  Frequently patients develop nose bleeds
and non-infectious conjunctivitis. Symptomatic treatment of these
problems  is  all that is indicated.  Less than 30%  of  patients
notice  temporary thinning of the hair.  Less than 10%  of  these
have  clinically apparent hair loss,  and hair density returns to
normal after treatment is discontinued.

   Approximately  20% of patients on isotretinoin  have  musculo-
skeletal pains.  These tend to be minor, and are relieved by non-
steroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents.   More  worrisome  are  the
skeletal abnormalities seen in patients on long term isotretinoin
treatment for various keratinizing disorders (7).  These patients
however  ,  were usually treated with higher doses of  2mg/kg/day
for more than two years.  The ossification disorder seen in these
patients   resembles  diffuse  idiopathic  skeletal   hypostosis.
Children  being  treated for these disoreders had x-ray  findings
suggesting premature closure of the epiphyses of the knees.

   More  recently,  in a small prospective study of  patients  on
doses  of  2  mg/kg/day  of isotretinoin  for  the  treatment  of
keratinizing   disorders,   radiologically  documented   skeletal
changes  were  noted  after only 6-12 months  of  therapy.  These
changes  consisted of slightly increased bone formation in  areas
of  ligament  attachment.  It is not yet known  whether  this  is
reversible.

   A  small number of patients may have a temporary flare of acne
at the onset of treatment. Some clinincians feel that this can be
minimized  by the administration of low dose prednisone  or  oral
antibiotics.

   Pseudotumor  cerebri  ( benign intracranial hypertension)  has
occurred  in patients treated with  isotretinoin.  Patients  with
headache,  nausea,  vomitting  or  visual disturbances should  be
screened for papilledema.  The drug should be stopped immediately
if papilledema is present.

   Patients  with visual disturbances should also be checked  for
corneal  opacities.  Corneal opacities occur more  frequently  in
those   patients  receiving  higher  doses  of  isotretinoin  for
keratinizing  disorders  but has also been reported  in  patients
treated for cystic acne. The opacities resolve six to seven weeks
after discontinuation of the drug.

   There  have been rare reports of inflammatory bowel disease in
patients  treated with isotretinoin.  Occasional patients  report
fatigue or lassitude.

Laboratory abnormalities

   One  fourth  of  patients treated  with  isotretinoin  develop
elevated  serum triglycerides during their  four- to  five- month
course  of  treatment for acne.  Approximately one eighth have  a
decrease  in  the  HDL  level and  one  sixteenth  have  elevated
chloresterol.  These  changes  usually resolve after  therapy  is
discontinued.  It  is  important to monitor blood lipids  at  the
onset  of therapy and at intervals of two to four weeks until  it
is seen that there are no significant changes.  Minor  elevations
in  triglycerides are best treated by dietary maneuvres.  It   is
not  known  what  role the lipid abnormalities may  play  in  the
production  of coronary heart disease,  but the risk is currently
thought  to  be low since abnormalities return  to  normal  after
therapy  is stopped.  It is perhaps best that patients with  high
triglyceride  elevations  be  treated with the  lowest  effective
dosage of isotretinoin for a shorter period of time. Triglyceride
elevations of greater than 500 mg/dL necessitate  discontinuation
of  the drug,  as these patients are at risk for developing acute
pancreatitis.  A few patients develop mild leukopenia, anemia, or
thrombocytosis. Mild pyuria and liver function test abnormalities
occasionally occur.  These changes appear to be reversible  after
discontinuation  of  the  drug  and are  usually  not  clinically
significant.

Isotretinoin and pregnancy

   The   most  serious  side  effect  of  isotretinoin   is   its
teratogenicity.  The  drug  should not be used by women  who  are
pregnant  or those who plan to become pregnant during  treatment.
Contraception is recommended for women taking the drug, beginning
one month before treatment,  and continuing until one month after
discontinuation of treatment.  Many physicians obtain a pregnancy
test within two weeks prior to starting therapy.

   Reported    fetal    abnormalities   include    hydrocephalus,
microcephalus,  abnormalities  of the external  ear  (micropinna,
small  or  absent external auditory  canals),  Micropthalmia  and
cardiovascular  abnormalities.  These abnormalities have  occured
only  in  children  born to mothers exposed to  the  drug  during
pregnancy.

   The   package  insert  recommends  that  patients  who  become
pregnant  discuss  with  their  physician  the  desirability   of
continuing the pregnancy.  Since the half-life of isotretinoin is
less than one to three days, it is believed that there is no risk
of  teratogenicity  during  subsequent pregnancies  occurring  at
least one month after treatment has been stopped.

   While  no reproduction studies have been performed  on  humans
taking  isotretinoin,  studies in rats have not revealed impaired
fertility. No significant changes have been seen in the number or
mobility of spermatazoa of human males receiving isotretinoin. As
it is not known whether isotretinoin is secreted into milk, it is
inadvisable to treat nursing mothers with the drug.

Dosage and administration

   Isotretinoin  is  presently approved by the FDA only  for  the
treatment of severe recalcitrant nodulocystic acne. While dosages
of 0.1,  0.5,  and 1.0 mg/kg/day orally seem equally effective in
inducing  a remission of acne,  there is a  significantly  higher
relapse rate in patients rate in patients treated at lower doses.
As  the goal of isotretinoin therapy is not only the clearing  of
active disease but the indefinite maintenance of clearing,  it is
recommended  that patients be treated with 1 mg/kg/day for  16-20
weeks. Extensive truncal lesions, which do not respond as quickly
or  completely as facial lesions,  may require dosages of 1.5-2.0
mg/kg/day. Isotretinoin is supplied in 10,20, and 20 mg capsules.
Most patients are treated with 40 mg twice daily. Patients should
be  advised not to ingest any vitamin A supplements during  their
treatment course.

Other indications

   Isotretinoin has also been shown to be effective for a variety
of  other skin disorders,  but it is not yet approved by the  FDA
for  these indications.  These include several variants of  acne:
hidradenitis   suppurativa,   gram  negative  folliculitis,   and
rosacea.

   Retinoids also have an antineoplastic effect. Several patients
with  the  basal  cell nervus  syndrome,  an  autosomal  dominant
disorder   in   which  patients  develop  multiple   basal   cell
carcinomas, have been treated. Isotretinoin resulted in reduction
in  tumor  sizes,  but  usually did not  completely  destroy  the
tumors.  Retinoids  are  also being studied for  possible  future
roles  in cancer prevention.  Isotretinoin and other retinoids  (
especially etretinate,  an aromatic retinoid not yet available in
the  US) have been used to treat a wide variety  of  keratinizing
skin  disorders,   such  as  psoriasis,  keratosis  follicularis,
ichthyosis,  pityriasis rubra pilaris, and others (8). Discussion
of  this is beyond the scope of this paper.  Although the drug is
very effective for several of these disorders,  the major problem
is  that  long-term  treatment  is  required  for  these  chronic
diseases,   and  long-term  safety  of  retinoids  has  not  been
established.

Conclusion

   Isotretinoin   (Accutane)  is  an  exceedingly  useful   drug,
producing dramatic prolonged remissions after four to five  weeks
in  most patients with severe nodulocystic acne.  Because of  its
side effects, teratogenicity, and cost (about $600 for a four- to
five- month course of treatment), the drug should be reserved for
the less than 1% of patients with severe acne.
